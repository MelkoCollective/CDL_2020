# Project 1: Machine Learning

This project will guide you through using a machine learning algorithm -- the Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) -- on molecular data. If you want some more exposure before you begin your tasks, supplemental reading on RBMs can be found [here](\href{https://qucumber.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_static/RBM_tutorial.pdf}), and a guide on training RBMs on a dummy dataset has been provided in a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_1_RBM_and_Tomography/RBM_train_dummy_dataset.ipynb). The base RBM code is located in [RBM_helper.py](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_1_RBM_and_Tomography/RBM_helper.py). We've intentionally left it to be bare-bones and easy to use.

Open up [Project1_LandingPage.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_1_RBM_and_Tomography/Project1_LandingPage.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

Tasks include:
* Train an RBM to reconstruct the potential energy of moleculary Hydrogen as the distance between the H atoms changes.
* Train an RBM to reconstruct the groundstate of a Rydberg atom quantum computer.

Further Challenges:
* Additional data has been provided for LiH and BeH2.
* Other unsupervised machine learning techniques can be used besides RBMs.

Possible Business Outcomes:
* Explain to a layperson why quantum computers are desired for quantum chemistry tasks.
* How do you place a value on data derived from a quantum computer?
