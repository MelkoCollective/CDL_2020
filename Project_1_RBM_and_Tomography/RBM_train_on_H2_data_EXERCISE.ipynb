    "## Train a RBM on H2 data\n",
    "\n",
    "This file gives you all the necessary tools to train an RBM on the sample date of a $H_2$ molecule. This [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.06860.pdf) provides all the technical details of how to construct the spin Hamiltonian for a $H_2$ molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handle data\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the data provided for the $H_2$ molecule in the `H2_data` folder and get familiar with it. The `R_XX_psi.txt` files provide the wave function for each radius of the $H_2$ molecule and the `R_XX_samples.txt` files provide each 10000 samples in the computational Z basis from the wavefunction. This is basically what you would get from a measurement in the lab when you would do measurements on the molecule in the Z basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculate Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Find a way to calculate the energy from these samples. Equation (1) in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.06860.pdf) shows you how to get the energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution: To provide sign free data we had to modify the Hamiltonian a bit. You will have to change the signs of $g_4$ and $g_5$ of [Equation (1)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.06860.pdf) to obtain the correct energy!**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to reproduce [Figure 3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.06860.pdf). If you are more familiar with wave functions you can also start with the exact wave function provided in `R_XX_psi.txt` instead of starting directly with the sample data. After you manage to calculate the energy correctly from the wavefunction you can think of the sample data as a wave function. E.g. the sample $[0,0]$ translates to a wavefunction $[1,0,0,0]$ and the energy can be obtain by an average over all samples for a given radius $R$. This approach will work for a small system like the $H_2$ molecule. For bigger systems you will have to find a better way to estimate the energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train an RBM on $H_2$ data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now train an RBM for each R. After successful training you will be able to sample from it and calculate the energy. Do this for each R and compare the energy from the learned wave function and the exact energy. How can you improve your result? "
