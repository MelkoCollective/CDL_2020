# Business Applications

**Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise:**

Found out stable configurations/distances of atoms in molecules. Important if you want to study stress on polymers, drugs, crystals, materials in general & any chemicals to see how they behave under different temperatures, because proteins denature at double the ambient temperatures or even earlier, polymers have complex numerically intractable relaxation times under high and very low temperatures - we only have estimations from dielectrics like Debye-Debye relaxation times/curves.

**Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve:** 

  1.Nitrogenase: nitrogen fixation to produce cheap fertilizer to make farming more accessible in the third world and difficult soil/slash the energy expedage of the world by 2%.
  
  2.Study drug design, material design, solar panel, battery and crystal design.
  
  3.Simulate phases of water (we know up to 9 phases, EZ water (4th phase is absolutely crucial in fluid dynamics) engineering applications.

**Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved:**

  1.Agriculture and FeMoco(nitrogenase) - any chemistry company. (Bayer, BASF, Ratiopharm, etc)
  
  2.Drug design: sell simulation license to Roche, Schroedigner or BASF, etc.
  
  3.Battery design: Tesla, any automotive player, Rocket fuel simulation - stable configurations of explosives, etc.
  
  4.Exceptionally good software tool: an R & D targetted powerful, interactive and an exhaustive simulation tool.
