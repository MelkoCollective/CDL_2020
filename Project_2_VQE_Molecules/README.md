## Project 2: VQE

In this project we have explored the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for constructing potential energy surfaces for small molecules: LiH, H<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>.

A very brief introduction to the main ideas behind the VQE are

## Tasks and Challenges


### Step #1: Generating PES using classical methods.

In this part, we implemented three most commly used methods for extraction of thr molecule structure: HF, CCSD, and FCI. All three methods scale polynomially with the system size  but fail to deliver chemical accuracy along PESs. We were, however, able to estimate approximately ground state Bound Energy.  

## Business Application
One again, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

* Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
* Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
* Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
* Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.

For more details refer to the [Business Application found here](./Business_Application.md)

## Presenting your results in your pull request
For your pull request, consider the following for the presentation of your final results:
- Work entirely in the directory for Project 2.
- Edit this README.md file with a highlight of your main technical results.  Provide links to any other files with your detailed results, e.g. Jupyter notebooks.
- For your Business Application, feel free to provide your answers directly in the 
[Business_Application.md](./Business_Application.md) file.
- Do not directly upload your video file (or any other large files) to the repository.  Instead, provide a link e.g. to a YouTube video, or a Google Drive file.
- Include a file contributions.md that lists the contributions of each group member.
