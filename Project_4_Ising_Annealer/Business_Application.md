## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

We have used a powerful optimisation algorithm called simulated annealing to find optimal solutions to the Ising model [1]. The Ising model was developed to describe the interaction of a collection of quantum spins, but it can be used to model many other problems. As two examples, we tackled solving for the magnetisation in a certain class of materials called ferromagnets, and calculating the energy-landascape of the Hydrogen molecule as its being stretched. These problems are formulated in a quantum-inspired way, such that the software is easy to adapt to running on a quantum annealer instead of simulated annealing. Such powerful annealing devices are available from companies such as D-Wave [2] and Fujitsu [3]. 


## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

The Ising model provides a model for machine learning and analysing neural networks [4,5,6]. With our powerful algorithms to solve the Ising model we can provide new tools into the machine-learning toolkit, particularly for giving insight into why a given input is mapped onto an output by the neural network [6]. The problem of why an AI algorithm based on neural networks makes a certain decison is a major hurdle preventing AI from being used in decision making by public entities in deomcratic systems. Thus analysis of the network that might provide insight into the decision making of the neural network is extremely valuable.


## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

The customers for our tools can be split into three categories:

### Governments

### Machine learning software companies

### Civil society 



## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
