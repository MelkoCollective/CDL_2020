## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

This weekâ€™s project focuses on finding the lowest energy of a system/body using thermal annealing Monte Carlo methods. Thermal annealing exploits thermal fluctuations to discover the ground state of a system. The Monte Carlo method has proven to be very efficient computational technique in attaining approximate numerical solutions to systems which are complex and difficult to solve analytically. Monte Carlo Simulation is iterative computational method used to examine and investigate the behavior of physical and mathematical systems utilizing random techniques.


## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

The utilization of Monte Carlo simulations and applications is found in widely (interdisciplinary)disparate fields and areas in chemistry, molecular dynamics, quantum physics, Ising model, electron dynamics, finance and business, telecommunications, remote sensing.
#### Biotechnology
>> Application of Monte Carlo Simulation in Optical Tweezers in Biotechnology has become an indispensable tool for quantitatively studying life processing and transforming life activities. It has applications in cancer cell sorting, enabling the identification of healthy or cancerous cells.

#### Food Safety 
Using predictive microbiology and the Monte Carlo simulation for assessing the level of exposure of a hazard. Helping the production of safer foodstuff and reducing the number of food borne illnesses.

#### Climate Science
Climate change impact assessment is subject to a range of uncertainties due to both incomplete and unknowable knowledge. We use monte carlo simulations to quantify uncertainties related to future greenhouse gas emissions, the climate sensitivity, and limitations and unpredictability in general circulation models.

#### Agriculture
The use of Monte Carlo methods to determine optical properties for quality and safety assessment of plant tissues, for example, to detect healthy and bruised apple tissue.

#### Astronomy 
Through solar radio astronomy scientist discovered the first planets outside the solar system. Monte carlo simulations is substantial to the increase in Astronomical knowledge.  

#### Energy Sector
Monte Carlo simulation can be used to analyse electricity markets. Players in the electricity market can use simulation to decide whether or not an investment can be expected to be profitable, and authorities can by means of simulation find out which consequences a certain market design can be expected to have on electricity prices, environmental impact, etc. 

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved




## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language
