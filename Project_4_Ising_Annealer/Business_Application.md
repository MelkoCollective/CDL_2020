# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consider the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

A brief example for each question is included for the 
[Traveling Salesman Problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

Example: Finding a global minimum in settings where a classical approach may not be able to do so.
Here we try to find the global minimum for a classical [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model), since it has various applications in physics and chemistry. Unfortunately that is a [hard task](https://archive.siam.org/pdf/news/654.pdf). Fortunately, the process of [thermal annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) is a simple but powerful heuristic that aims to get to a variable configuration (spins in this case) that gives us the global minimum without exhaustively searching all the solutions.

As an example, here we map the electronic structure Hamiltonian of an H<sub>2</sub> molecule to an ising objective function, and try to find the ground state by thermal annealing.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Being able to map the discrete electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and extended systems by simulating hundreds of interacting spins through an Ising-type Hamiltonian will provide a better understanding of the motions of electrons within atoms and molecules. Quantum chemical results with quantum computational chemistry can be the bridge to applications in real world. For example, the properties of all materials and devices are determined at the atomic level. Therefore, it is important to understand such systems, to predict their behavior, and to use this knowledge in order to improve materials properties and optimize device performance

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

Starting from quantum chemical calculations to calculate transition states, activation barriers, reaction rates and using this knowledge into kinetic Monte Carlo studying the population of different species 
1.	Chemical reactors 
- Identifying molecular structures
-	Binding/activation energies
-	Interaction energies
-	Vibrational frequencies 
2.	Solar cell cars
-	Solar cells—efficiency and lifetime
-	Battery—capacity, charge speed and lifetime
-	Paint and glass—optical properties and coatings 
-	Materials—mechanical properties 
3.	Smart phones (IPhone)
-	OLEDs/QLEDs—lifetime, color, and efficiency
-	Quantum electronics—capacity
-	Batteries
-	Materials 


## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
