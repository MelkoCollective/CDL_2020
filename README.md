##Open collaboration of the Quantum Bootcamp 2020

Goal: to calculate quantum properties of several few-electron diatomic molecules, such as moledular Hydrogen, Helium, or Lithium Hydride. 

###Challenges include
* Preparing ground state and excited state energies from an electronic structure Hamiltonian.
* Preparing rotational and vibronic properties from the appropriate Hamiltonian.
* Calculating the above properties using data from a real or virtual quantum device.

###Resources include 
* Quantum-inspired classical simulation techniques
* Quantum hardware including circut-based devices and quantum annealers
* Data for use in machine learning reconstruction techniques
