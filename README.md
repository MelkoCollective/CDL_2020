# CDL_2020
## Quantum Bootcamp Cohort Project 2020

The 2020 Cohort Project is an online collaboration bringing together founders in a series of open-source challenges.
During the four-week bootcamp, founders will form teams to compete and collaborate on a set of challenges
relevant for the Quantum Incubator Stream.  This year's challenges will focus on Quantum Chemistry.

Goals: 
* To calculate quantum properties of several few-electron diatomic molecules, such as moledular Hydrogen, Helium, or Lithium Hydride.
* To disseminate the results of the collaboration in an open access format accessible to all quantum entrepreneurs

### 2020 Challenges
Four separate challenges will be issued; one per week.  

* Reconstructing a quantum state from data using Machine Learning
* Preparing ground state and excited state energies from an electronic structure Hamiltonian.
* Studying rotational and vibronic properties and Frank Conon Factors.
* Calculating the above properties using data from a real or virtual quantum device.

### Resources include 
* Quantum-inspired classical simulation techniques
* Quantum hardware including circut-based devices and quantum annealers
* Data for use in machine learning reconstruction techniques
