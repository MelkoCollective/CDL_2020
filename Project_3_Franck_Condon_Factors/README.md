## Project 3: Franck-Condon Factors

Below are the links to our files for the following tasks and challenges:

## Tasks include:
* Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of molecular Hydrogen using a simple model

[Task1](https://github.com/tina-seb/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_3_Franck_Condon_Factors/Solution.ipynb)

* Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of a more complex molecule (V<sub>3</sub>) using matrix elements

[Task2](https://github.com/tina-seb/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_3_Franck_Condon_Factors/Solution.ipynb)

* Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of that molecule using vibronic sampling. This calculation involves Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), which would allow these factors to be calculated using a quantum circuit.

## Further Challenges:

* What are advantages and disadvantages of codes licensed for the public domain and those that are licensed for private use

## Business Application
