## Project 3: Franck-Condon Factors

Task 1 : Calculating FCF for H2-H2+ molecule

Using the approximation of the harmonic oscillator, we calculate classically the vibronic transitions for given energy levels determining associated Franck Condon Factors.

## Tasks include:
* Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of molecular Hydrogen using a simple model
* Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of a more complex molecule (V<sub>3</sub>) using matrix elements
* Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of that molecule using vibronic sampling. This calculation involves Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), which would allow these factors to be calculated using a quantum circuit.

## Further Challenges:
* An alternative and analogous method to calculating these Franck-Condon Factors using matrix elements is to use a loop hafnian approach. This loop hafnian approach uses GBS which would allow these factors to be calculated using a quantum circuit. Use the result of Task 3 to provide data to a skeleton code provided that uses loop hafnians to calculate the Franck-Condon Factors.
* Explain briefly the similarities and differences between these three methods.
* What are advantages and disadvantages of codes licensed for the public domain and those that are licensed for private use
