## Project 3: Franck-Condon Factors

In this project our team calculated Franck-Condon Factors (FCF), which are useful in studying vibronic transitions in molecules. We applied different techniques in finding FCF such as harmonic oscillator approximation, Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), and Hermite polynomials.

## Tasks and Challenges:

1. [Task #1](https://github.com/olgOk/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_3_Franck_Condon_Factors/Task1.ipynb) Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of molecular Hydrogen using a simple model

2. [Task #2](https://github.com/olgOk/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_3_Franck_Condon_Factors/Task2Code/Task2.ipynb) Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of a more complex molecule (V<sub>3</sub>) using matrix elements

3. [Task #3](https://github.com/olgOk/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_3_Franck_Condon_Factors/Task3.ipynb) Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of that molecule using vibronic sampling. This calculation involves Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), which would allow these factors to be calculated using a quantum circuit.
