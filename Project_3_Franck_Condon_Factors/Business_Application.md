# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consdier the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

A brief example for each question is included for the 
[Traveling Salesman Problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

The technical problem we solved in this exercise involves calculating the Frank Cordon Factors (FCFs), which are useful in studying vibronic transitions in molecules. We calculated the FCFs for H2-H2+ using the harmonic oscillator approximation. Calculating FCFs is basically the same as calculating the overlap between the wavefunctions before and after the vibronic transitions. We then calculated the photoionization spectrum for V3 and finally simulated a Gaussian Boson Sampling experiment, which generates samples for computing a vibronic spectrum.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Some of the real world problems that this solution can solve include :

1) Astronomy

2) Drug Discovery - Vibrational spectroscopies, including infrared and Raman techniques, are important tools
for the characterization of chemical composition, molecular structures, and chain orientation under
mechanical deformation of polymeric materials.

3) Chemical Sensor Applications in Medicine and Climate Science

While frequently regarded as pure laboratory techniques, the corresponding methods, namely infrared and Raman spectroscopy, have successfully been used as transducers for chemical sensors. Other than most standard transducers, vibrational spectroscopic sensors are capable of multi-component detection, both qualitatively and quantitatively. With the development of improved systems and the introduction of novel components, fully portable sensing systems can now be built at competitive prices. This opens a wide field of possible applications, covering in-situ real-time industrial process control as well as environmental pollutant screening. This has applications in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Climate Science.

4) Manufacturing

The development of fiber-optic-based spectrometers has broadened the use of vibrational spectroscopy for process monitoring in various fields including
polymerization, curing, and manufacturing processes.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

Examples: 
- Federal Express
- Canada Post

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
