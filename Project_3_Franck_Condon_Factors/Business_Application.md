# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application



## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise
The aim of this exercise was to derive a fundamental molecular property named Franck Condons Factor using classical and breakthrough quantum computing methods. This quantity is crucial to assess spectroscopic properties, and digs up the knowledge of the inherent structure of the molecule. 

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

For the purpose of Chemical Identification:
•	Chemical agent Identification/Detection in chemical warfare or terrorist attacks
•	Detecting airborne chemical threats
•	Biological agent Identification/D in warfare
•	Real-time industrial monitoring
•	Identification of Toxic Industrial Materials and Toxic Industrial Chemicals by public health safety bodies, industry regulators and auditors, e.g:
•	Gas leaks in mines 
•	Nuclear Powerplants
•	Chemical Plants
•	Food quality assessment (e.g. of dairy or meat products) in exports/imported goods
•	Identifying counterfeit food products (e.g. honey, olive oil) which may contain substances harmful if ingested
•	Respiratory gas analysis in hospitals
•	Real time monitoring dissolved oxygen content in freshwater and marine ecosystems
•	Aviation security (e.g. trace detectors at airport checkpoints for illicit drugs or explosives)
For the purpose of Molecule Property Discovery:
•	Reduces time for drug/molecule discovery for use in the pharmaceutical industry or new material discovery
•	Characterization of proteins
•	Chemical disaster management
•	Reduces time needed to analyze unknown chemical or biological agents in warfare or terrorist attacks, and hence reduces response time


## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

Chemical Detection Equipment (CDE) Market
Background:
-	The threat of hostile use of explosives against both military and civilian targets is always evolving. New explosive materials are being developed to evade detection and the means by which the explosive device is camouflaged and delivered to its target are always changing. The fast and specific detection of the presence of chemical weapons or toxic industrial chemicals is of critical importance in both military and public safety environments. The speed of the detection permits the use of protective counter-measures and quickly identifying the agent facilitates effective treatment of the victims. Growth in the CDE market is driven by an increase in global terrorist threats, and increasing safety regulations resulting from increasing awareness among people and the enforcement of stringent government regulations.
Problem we are solving:
-	Alongside CDE’s technical performance, CDEs are also judged on their price and total cost of device ownership. Currently, the high operating cost (cost of the chemicals used in making detection equipment) is hindering the growth of the global chemical detection equipment market.


Market Entry Strategy:
-	Initial CDE Segment to target:
  - We will be targeting the defence sector – anti-terrorism, chemical disaster management, detecting air-borne chemical threats
-	Initial CDE geography to target:
The largest geographical market for CDE correlates to countries most affected by terrorism
  - Initially, we will be targeting the US as North America is the largest market for chemical detection technology
  - Followed by India, France and the UK which are the subsequent countries identified to be most vulnerable to terrorism

Target Customers:
Suppliers of Chemical Detection Equipment to the government and commercial industries:

-	Thermo Fisher Scientific Incorporation and Smiths Group Plc = 39.45% market share in 2017
o	2 dominant players in the CDE market
-	Bruker Corporation = 4.88% market share in 2017
-	FLIR Systems Inc. = 4.67% market share in 2017
-	S. E. International
-	3M Detection Solutions
-	Argon Electronics
-	S2 Threat Detection Technologies
-	Romtech
-	ChemImage Corp.
-	Implant Sciences Corporation

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
