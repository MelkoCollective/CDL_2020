# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application



## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise
In this exercise we to derived a fundamental molecular property named Franck Condon Factor using classical and quantum computing methods. This quantity is crucial to assess spectroscopic properties, and helps us study vibronic transitions in molecules. Utilizing Boson Sampling techniques, we can leverage a exponential speedup over classical computers with near term quantum devices when sampling over the quantum optics or photonics field.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

For the purpose of Chemical Identification:
- Chemical agent identification/detection in chemical warfare or terrorist attacks
- Detecting airborne chemical threats
- Biological agent identification/detection in warfare
- Real-time industrial monitoring
- Identification of toxic industrial materials and toxic industrial chemicals by public health safety bodies, industry regulators and auditors, e.g:
    - Gas leaks in mines, nuclear powerplants, or chemical plants
- Food quality assessment (e.g. of dairy or meat products) in exports/imported goods
- Identifying counterfeit food products (e.g. honey, olive oil) which may contain substances harmful if ingested
- Respiratory gas analysis in hospitals
- Real time monitoring dissolved oxygen content in freshwater and marine ecosystems
- Aviation security (e.g. trace detectors at airport checkpoints for illicit drugs or explosives)

For the purpose of Molecule Property Discovery:
- Reduces time for drug/molecule discovery for use in the pharmaceutical industry or new material discovery
- Characterization of proteins
- Chemical disaster management
- Reduces time needed to analyze unknown chemical or biological agents in warfare or terrorist attacks, and hence reduces response time


## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

#### Chemical Detection Equipment (CDE) Market
**Market Entry Strategy:**
- Initial CDE Segment to target:
    - We will be targeting the defence sector – anti-terrorism, chemical disaster management, detecting air-borne chemical threats
- Initial CDE geography to target:
The largest geographical market for CDE correlates to countries most affected by terrorism
  - Initially, we will be targeting the US as North America is the largest market for chemical detection technology
  - Followed by India, France and the UK which are the subsequent countries identified to be most vulnerable to terrorism

Background:
-	The threat of hostile use of explosives against both military and civilian targets is always evolving. As a rule of war, new explosive materials are continuously being developed and camouflage and delivery techniques are always changing. The **fast** and **specific** **detection** of the presence of chemical weapons or toxic industrial chemicals is of critical importance in both military and public safety environments in order to enact protective counter-measures and to quickly identify the effective treatments for those injured. 
-   Growth in the CDE market is driven by an increase in global terrorist threats and increasing government (US & international) on the buying and selling of hazardous materials 

Problem we are solving:
-	Alongside CDE’s technical performance, CDEs are also judged on their price and total cost of device ownership. Currently, the high operating cost, primarily from the cost of the chemicals used in making detection equipment, is hindering the growth of the global chemical detection equipment market.

Target Customers:
Suppliers of Chemical Detection Equipment to the government and commercial industries:

- Thermo Fisher Scientific Incorporation and Smiths Group Plc = 39.45% market share in 2017
- Bruker Corporation = 4.88% market share in 2017
- FLIR Systems Inc. = 4.67% market share in 2017
- S. E. International
- 3M Detection Solutions
- Argon Electronics
- S2 Threat Detection Technologies
- Romtech
- ChemImage Corp.
- Implant Sciences Corporation
