# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application


### Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

We learned about the behavior of how molecules interact with light by using a variety of sampling methods, in particular Boson sampling. 
Calculating the Frank Conon Factors, we were able to study the vibronic transitions in a diatomic molecule, H2. This gives us a spectroscopic profile of the molecules which is critical for fields such as drug discovery, magnetic-resonance imaging, climate science optics and astronomy.

### Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Some of the real world problems that could be solved could be the estimation of wood exposure times by utilizing near infrared spectroscopy which wouldn't be possible without the Frank Conon Factors. 

Food scientists would use this to take measuemrents of differnet compounds in samples of food by utilizing the abosrption spectroscopy in both the visible and invisible spectrum. 

The medical indsutry would benefit highly by taking more accurate measurements of toxic compounds in blood samples in addition to having a method for non-destructive elemental analysis by using x-ray fluroesence, which wouldn't be possible without the efficient calculations of Frank Conon Factors.

### Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

* GE Healthcare
* Hitachi Medical
* Orion Telescopes
* Lacroix Optics

### Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language
